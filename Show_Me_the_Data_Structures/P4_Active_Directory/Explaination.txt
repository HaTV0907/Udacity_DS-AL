In this implementation, the is_user_in_group function takes two arguments:
    + the user (which is a string representing the user's ID)
    + the group (which is an instance of the Group class).

The function first checks if the user is directly in the current group by using the get_users method of the Group class.
If the user is found, it returns True.

If the user is not directly in the group, the function recursively calls itself for each subgroup of the current group.
This allows us to traverse the group hierarchy and check if the user is in any of the subgroups.

Finally, if the user is not found in the group or any subgroups, the function returns False.
