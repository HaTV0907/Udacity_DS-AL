In this code, the find_files function takes a directory path and an extension as input.
It uses os.listdir to get a list of all files and directories in the given directory. For each item in the list,
it checks if it is a file and if the filename ends with the specified extension.
If it does, the file path is appended to the files list. If the item is a directory,
the function recursively calls itself with the subdirectory as the new directory parameter.

By using this recursive approach, we can traverse through all directories and subdirectories to find files with the desired extension.
