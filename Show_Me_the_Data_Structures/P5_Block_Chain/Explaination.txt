In the Block class, we initialize the block with a timestamp, data, and the hash of the previous block.
The calc_hash method calculates the hash of the block by concatenating the timestamp, data, and previous hash,
and then calculating the SHA-256 hash.

In the Blockchain class, we have a head attribute that points to the first block in the chain.
The add_block method adds a new block to the chain by creating a new Block object and updating the head pointer.

The print_blocks method to the Blockchain class. This method iterates through each block in the chain
and prints its timestamp, data, previous hash, and hash.
After adding the blocks to the blockchain, you can call the print_blocks method to display the results.
