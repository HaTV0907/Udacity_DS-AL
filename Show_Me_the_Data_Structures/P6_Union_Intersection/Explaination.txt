In the union function, we create a new linked list called union_list to store the union of the two linked lists.
We then traverse the first linked list (llist_1) and add its elements to the union_list.
Next, we traverse the second linked list (llist_2) and add its elements to the union_list only if they are not already present in the union_list

In the intersection function, we create a new linked list called intersection_list to store the intersection of the two linked lists.
We traverse the first linked list (llist_1) and check if each element is present in the second linked list (llist_2).
If it is, we add it to the intersection_list.

The time and space efficiency of the code depends on the size of the input linked lists,
denoted as n and m, where n is the size of the first linked list and m is the size of the second linked list.

For the union function:

Time Complexity: The time complexity of the union function is O(n + m).
This is because we traverse both linked lists once to add their elements to the union_list.
The time complexity of traversing a linked list is O(n) where n is the size of the linked list.
Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n + m).

Space Complexity: The space complexity of the union function is O(n + m).
This is because we create a new linked list union_list to store the union of the two linked lists.
The space complexity of creating a new linked list is proportional to the number of elements in the union, which is at most n + m.

For the intersection function:

Time Complexity: The time complexity of the intersection function is O(n * m).
This is because for each element in the first linked list, we check if it is present in the second linked list using the contains method.
The contains method has a time complexity of O(m) where m is the size of the second linked list.
Therefore, for each element in the first linked list, we perform O(m) operations.
Since there are n elements in the first linked list, the overall time complexity is O(n * m).

Space Complexity: The space complexity of the intersection function is O(min(n, m)).
This is because we create a new linked list intersection_list to store the intersection of the two linked lists.
The space complexity is proportional to the number of elements in the intersection, which is at most the size of the smaller linked list (n or m).

It's important to note that these time and space complexities assume that the contains method in the LinkedList class has a time complexity of O(n),
where n is the size of the linked list.
If the contains method has a different time complexity, the overall time complexity of the intersection function may change accordingly.
