In the union function, we create a new linked list called union_list to store the union of the two linked lists.
We then traverse the first linked list (llist_1) and add its elements to the union_list.
Next, we traverse the second linked list (llist_2) and add its elements to the union_list only if they are not already present in the union_list

In the intersection function, we create a new linked list called intersection_list to store the intersection of the two linked lists.
We traverse the first linked list (llist_1) and check if each element is present in the second linked list (llist_2).
If it is, we add it to the intersection_list.
